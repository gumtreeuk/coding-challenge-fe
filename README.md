# Frontend Coding Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to replicate the counter in the below image in React.js. The user should be able to increment and decrement the number in the counter using the plus and minus buttons.

![example counter](./public/example.png "Example")

## Setup
``` bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run app in development mode (http://localhost:3000)
npm start
```
Once the app is running in development mode, it will automatically reload when changes are made to the code.
